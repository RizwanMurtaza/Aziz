For Gaming PC Repair/Parts shops, the most successful logos use:
- **Geometric shapes** (hexagons, shields)
- **Gradient colors** (your orange #ff6b35 is perfect)
- **Bold, angular fonts**
- **Simple icons** that work at small sizes
- **Negative space** cleverly

### 5. **Quick Text-Based Solution:**

For immediate use, consider just using styled text:
```
GPC
REHAB
```
With:
- "GPC" in bold Orbitron font
- "REHAB" smaller underneath
- Orange gradient on "GPC"
- White or grey "REHAB"

### 6. **Icon Font Alternative:**

Use Font Awesome icons as logos:
- `fa-microchip` - Processor icon
- `fa-memory` - RAM icon
- `fa-tools` - Repair tools
- `fa-desktop` - Computer icon

These can be styled with CSS gradients and effects.

## Implementation:

To use a Font Awesome icon as logo:
```html
<i class="fas fa-microchip logo-icon"></i>
```

With CSS:
```css
.logo-icon {
    font-size: 40px;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff6b35, #ff4500);
    -webkit-background-clip: text;
    -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
}
```

## My Recommendation:
For a professional look that matches your theme, I suggest:
1. Use a professional logo maker (Canva or Hatchful)
2. Focus on GPU/Graphics card imagery (most recognizable)
3. Keep it simple - avoid too many details
4. Ensure it works in monochrome too
5. Test at multiple sizes (favicon to billboard)
